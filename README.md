Python implementations of basic algorithms 
in Computer Vision including: 
- Canny Edge Detection 
- Hough Lines Detection 
- Hough Circles Detection
- SIFT Feature Descriptor
- Harris Operator
- K-means Segmentation
- Mean Shift Segmentation
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Region Growing Segmentation
- Global Optimal Thresholding
- Global Otsu Thresholding

Numpy/Scipy are the only dependencies in algorithms implementation, where OpenCV is just used for 
images load/display and drawing lines/circles.
