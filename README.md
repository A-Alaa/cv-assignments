# cv-assignments

Python implementations of basic algorithms 
in Computer Vision including Canny Edge Detection, Hough Lines detection and Hough Circles detection.
Numpy/Scipy are the only dependencies in algorithms implementation, Where OpenCV is just used for 
images load/display and drawing lines/circles.
